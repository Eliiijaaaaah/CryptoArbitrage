# CryptoArbitrage
This is a program written in C (for a class project), that pulls crypto data from https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/ to find the best buy/sell combination.

Here's the best explanation of CryptoArbitrage I've read "A Cryptocurrency arbitrage to find the largest delta between a Cryptocurrency on two exchanges. The program inputs the price of cryptocurrencies on user exchanges then finds the largest delta between any two currencies on any two exchanges and uses transfer/exchange fee to find the most profitable trade, if any.". This can be found in the repository  at https://github.com/aruneswara/CryptoArbitrage
